## Post 1: Quarterly Taxes Pain Point

**Best for:** Freelance tax groups, general freelance groups

```
Hey fellow freelancers! 👋

Quick question — how many of you dread quarterly tax season?

I built a free tool that calculates your exact quarterly estimated tax payment in about 30 seconds. No sign-up, no email capture, no paywall.

Just plug in your income, filing status, and state → get your federal + SE tax + quarterly amount instantly.

I also wrote a detailed guide on how quarterly taxes actually work (deadlines, safe harbor rule, penalties): https://lancercalc.com/blog/quarterly-taxes-freelancer-guide-2025

Free calculator here: https://lancercalc.com/freelance-tax-calculator

Built this because I was tired of Googling "how much tax do freelancers pay" and getting 10 pages of ads for $30/month software. Hope it helps someone!

## Post 2: Undercharging Problem

**Best for:** Freelance pricing groups, design/dev groups

```
Unpopular opinion: Most freelancers are charging WAY less than they should.

I ran the numbers. To actually take home $80K/year as a freelancer, you need to charge around $137/hour (not $50-60 like most people think).

Why? Because after self-employment tax (15.3%), federal tax, health insurance, retirement, and accounting for non-billable hours... that $50/hr rate leaves you with maybe $28K.

I built a free calculator that shows you the real math: https://lancercalc.com/hourly-rate-calculator

And wrote a full breakdown of the formula: https://lancercalc.com/blog/freelance-hourly-rate-guide-2025

No sign-up. No email required. Just honest math.

What hourly rate did you get? (Most people are shocked.)

## Post 3: 1099 vs W-2 Comparison

**Best for:** Career transition groups, tech freelance groups

```
PSA for anyone considering leaving a full-time job for freelancing (or vice versa):

A $130K 1099 contract can actually pay LESS than a $100K W-2 salary.

Sounds crazy, but when you factor in:
- Self-employment tax (15.3% vs 7.65%)
- No employer health insurance ($8K-$20K/year)
- No 401K match ($3K-$6K/year)
- No paid vacation ($4K-$5K/year)

The $100K W-2 job is often worth ~$108K while the $130K contract nets ~$103K.

I built a free side-by-side calculator so you can compare YOUR specific numbers: https://lancercalc.com/1099-vs-w2-calculator

Full breakdown article: https://lancercalc.com/blog/1099-vs-w2-real-difference

Not trying to scare anyone away from freelancing (I freelance myself). Just want people to negotiate the RIGHT rate.

## Post 4: Tax Deductions Checklist

**Best for:** All freelance groups, tax season timing

```
It's tax season and I see the same question every year: "What can I actually deduct as a freelancer?"

I put together a list of 25 deductions most freelancers miss — including some you probably didn't know about:

- The 50% SE tax deduction (this one is automatic but many don't realize it)
- Home office ($5/sq ft simplified method = up to $1,500)
- Health insurance premiums (100% deductible!)
- Solo 401(k) contributions (up to $69K in 2025)
- Software subscriptions, equipment, even your internet bill

Full article with all 25: https://lancercalc.com/blog/freelancer-tax-deductions-2025

And if you want to see exactly how much tax you owe: https://lancercalc.com/freelance-tax-calculator

Everything is free. No accounts. No paywalls. Just built this because I needed these tools myself.

## Post 5: General Launch / All Tools

```
I built something I wish existed when I started freelancing — a free financial toolkit specifically for freelancers.

🧾 Tax Calculator — see exactly what you owe in federal, state, and SE tax
⏱️ Hourly Rate Calculator — find your REAL minimum rate (spoiler: it's higher than you think)
⚖️ 1099 vs W-2 Comparison — see the actual take-home difference
📄 Invoice Generator — create professional PDFs with your logo, no watermark

Plus a blog with guides on quarterly taxes, self-employment tax, pricing, and deductions.

I'm a solo developer and built this because every "free" freelance tool I found was either paywalled after 3 uses or required an account. Happy to answer any questions!

## Post 6: Invoice Generator

**Best for:** New freelancer groups, Fiverr/Upwork groups

```
Tired of invoice generators that slap their watermark on your PDF unless you pay $10/month?

I built a completely free invoice generator for freelancers:
- Add your logo
- Multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, INR)
- Custom tax label (VAT, GST, Sales Tax)
- Discount field
- PAID stamp
- Live preview
- Download as PDF

No sign-up. No watermark. No limit. Your data never leaves your browser.

https://lancercalc.com/invoice-generator

If you need a quick invoice right now, this should take about 60 seconds.
